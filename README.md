# ContinuificationControl
Here we store all the material (videos and robots' CAD model) regarding [Maffettone et al, 2024].

Specifically there are 4 folders:

continuous_simulations: containing the videos of the numerical integration of the the continuified controlled model (the spatio-temporal evolution of the density and of the error function are reported), consisting in the result of a finite volume method;

discrete_simulations: containing the videos of the discretizzed trials;

experiments: containing videos of the experiments we conducted.

In each of these folders there are 4 videos regarding all the setups we considered:

Monomodal regulation: the desired density to achieve is a static monomodal von mises function;
Multimodal regulation: the desired density to achieve is a static multimodal von mises function;
Monomodal tracking: the desired density to achieve is a time varying monomodal von mises function;
Multimodal tracking: the desired density to achieve is a time varying multimodal von mises function;

Moreover we report the CAD model of the differential drive robot in the folder "differential_drive_robot_CAD"
